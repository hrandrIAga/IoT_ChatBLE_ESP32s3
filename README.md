# IoT_ChatBLE_ESP32s3
This program connects 3 Esp32S3 in BLE, and establishes a chat between them.  The program uses the serial port of each user.  It first asks the user to enter their name for the chat.  The user can then enter messages (choosing the receiver) and receive messages from other connected users.
